# OSINTECA Analyst-Centered Evolution Roadmap

This roadmap is written from the perspective of an analyst doing real investigative work. The unit of progress is not “more links”; it is **more reliable decisions with less friction and better provenance**.

## Maturity model

### Level 0 — Link collection

**Question:** Where can I search?

Capabilities:

- thematic lists;
- meta-indexes;
- basic country links.

Risk: lots of discovery, little trust.

### Level 1 — Trusted resource catalog

**Question:** Which source should I use, and can I trust that the entry is current?

Capabilities:

- canonical IDs;
- structured metadata;
- access model;
- jurisdiction;
- validation state;
- last-verified date;
- deduplication;
- link health.

Acceptance criteria:

- every machine-readable entry passes schema validation;
- duplicates are blocked;
- verified entries carry a human review date;
- stale/broken resources are automatically surfaced.

### Level 2 — Jurisdiction-aware atlas

**Question:** Which authoritative sources apply here?

Capabilities:

- national/federal sources;
- states/provinces/regions;
- municipal/local data;
- courts;
- companies;
- property;
- procurement;
- elections/civic data;
- environment;
- archives/media;
- cyber/public infrastructure.

Acceptance criteria:

- Brazil covers federal + all 27 UFs;
- each country page distinguishes official from commercial/community sources;
- legal/privacy notes are visible at point of use.

### Level 3 — Evidence-first investigation

**Question:** Can another analyst reproduce what I saw?

Capabilities:

- provenance template;
- capture/archive workflow;
- timestamps;
- hashes where appropriate;
- evidence labels: observed / claimed / corroborated / inferred / unresolved;
- confidence model;
- evidence bundles.

Acceptance criteria:

- every playbook includes preservation;
- important findings can be traced to a source and capture event;
- generated reports distinguish evidence from inference.

### Level 4 — Analyst playbooks

**Question:** What sequence should I follow?

Playbooks:

- people/identity;
- missing persons;
- company/ownership;
- GEOINT verification;
- image/video verification;
- CTI enrichment;
- conflict verification;
- environmental investigation;
- transport/maritime/aviation;
- web history;
- public-record research.

Each playbook should include:

1. intelligence requirement;
2. scope/red lines;
3. source map;
4. collection;
5. preservation;
6. validation;
7. pivots;
8. alternative hypotheses;
9. confidence;
10. dissemination/stop condition.

### Level 5 — Searchable analyst workbench

**Question:** Can I find the right source in seconds?

Capabilities:

- GitHub Pages;
- full-text search;
- filters by country, discipline, use case, access and validation;
- resource cards;
- direct catalog permalinks;
- mobile-first interface;
- English / Portuguese;
- saved filter URLs.

Acceptance criteria:

- no analyst needs to browse the repository tree to find a source;
- every resource page shows jurisdiction, purpose, validation and caveats.

### Level 6 — Intelligence knowledge graph

**Question:** How do resources, entities, evidence and cases connect?

Model:

    Resource ↔ Jurisdiction ↔ Discipline ↔ Use Case
        ↕
      Entity ↔ Relationship ↔ Evidence
        ↕
       Case ↔ Hypothesis ↔ Assessment

Capabilities:

- entity IDs;
- typed relationships;
- evidence provenance;
- confidence per assertion;
- graph export;
- STIX where appropriate for CTI;
- analyst case graph separated from public resource graph.

### Level 7 — Change intelligence & monitoring

**Question:** What changed since yesterday?

Capabilities:

- source freshness;
- redirect/ownership changes;
- GitHub archive/release detection;
- RSS monitoring;
- government/regulatory updates;
- environmental alerts;
- CTI advisories;
- diff reports;
- stale-source queue.

Principle: alerts identify change; analysts decide significance.

### Level 8 — AI-assisted analysis with provenance

**Question:** Can automation reduce repetitive work without inventing facts?

Capabilities:

- entity extraction;
- tagging;
- translation;
- summarization with citations;
- duplicate/entity candidate detection;
- timeline normalization;
- query expansion;
- source triage.

Guardrails:

- AI output is never a source;
- candidate identity is never identity proof;
- every material model-assisted transformation is traceable.

### Level 9 — Training & community

**Question:** Can a new analyst learn the tradecraft safely?

Capabilities:

- sanitized challenges;
- progressive missions;
- solution writeups;
- methodology reviews;
- evidence-quality exercises;
- contributor onboarding;
- reviewer calibration.

Trace Labs is the primary inspiration for this layer.

### Level 10 — OSINTECA 1.0

Definition of done:

- global discovery atlas + deep jurisdiction packs;
- structured catalog/API;
- evidence-first playbooks;
- searchable UI;
- provenance-aware graph;
- quality automation;
- analyst training;
- documented governance;
- clear separation of collection, evidence and analysis.

## Priority order

1. Finish catalog coverage and provenance.
2. Build Brazil federal + 27 UF atlas.
3. Add evidence templates and playbooks.
4. Build searchable GitHub Pages.
5. Add lifecycle/change monitoring.
6. Add knowledge graph.
7. Add Academy/challenges.
8. Expand country coverage systematically.

That order is intentional. A graph of bad data is just a faster way to be wrong.


## 2026–2027 priority sequence

1. Build collection discipline before automation.
2. Master evidence preservation before high-volume collection.
3. Learn target-input pivots and source evaluation.
4. Develop GEOINT, SOCMINT, corporate and CTI specialization tracks.
5. Learn entity resolution and graph reasoning.
6. Add change intelligence and monitoring.
7. Use AI for triage, translation and normalization only with traceable sources.
8. Practice analytical writing, confidence language and alternative hypotheses.
9. Teach and review others to calibrate judgment.
10. Contribute validated sources back to OSINTECA.

The goal is not an analyst who can name 500 tools. It is an analyst who knows which source to use, why, what it cannot prove, and how to preserve the evidence.
