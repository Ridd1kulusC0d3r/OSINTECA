# Investigation Workbenches

Tool lists answer **where can I search?** Workbenches answer **how do I organize the investigation after I start finding things?**

## Design lesson

The strongest idea surfaced by OSINT Shifu's investigation category is that collection and case management should be separate layers.

A tool can find a lead. The workbench should preserve **why that lead matters, where it came from, how it relates to other evidence, and how confident the analyst is**.
