# Cyber Threat Intelligence & OT/ICS OSINT

> Focus: defensive research, threat intelligence, exposure awareness and authorized environments.
>
> Tools that can actively probe systems must only be used on infrastructure you own or are explicitly authorized to assess.

## Defensive workflow

1. Define the protected organization/sector.
2. Build an asset and supplier hypothesis from public sources.
3. Use passive internet-measurement/search services first.
4. Correlate domains, certificates, IP space, vendors and exposed technologies.
5. Map threat actors, campaigns, malware and TTPs in MISP/OpenCTI.
6. Validate exposure only with authorization.
7. Feed defensible findings into detection engineering, threat hunting and risk reduction.

OSINTECA intentionally does not provide operational instructions for interacting with live industrial control systems.
